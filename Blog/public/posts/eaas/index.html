    <p>You&rsquo;ll own nothing and you&rsquo;ll be happy.
It seems everything is turning into a subscription service these days.
Not only do we subscribe to more services than ever before, but more and more things that used to be one-time purchases are turning to subscription models.
You can no longer buy licenses to use a piece of software; instead, you subscribe to a service which lets you use that piece of software.
The latest thing on the the chopping block is the car.
So called &ldquo;Cars-as-a-Service&rdquo; or &ldquo;Vehicles-as-a-Service&rdquo; is the hot new business model, aiming to &ldquo;simplify&rdquo; car ownership and usage.
This is just the latest in a long line of things for which traditional ownership is becoming more and more difficult.</p>
<p>The direction things are heading in is no accident.
The service-model is more profitable and a more stable source of income for businesses.
Why sell a car if you could instead rent it out forever?</p>
<p>This makes us poorer overall, and the usurers richer.
We are encouraged to rent everything and to have nothing to call our own.
You won&rsquo;t own your home, your car, your clothes, your media, nothing.
The worst aspect of it all is the reliance on the system it fosters.
A man cannot be independent if he must rent and borrow.
It&rsquo;s complete and utter reliance on the machine and is abhorrent.</p>
<p>This reliance on the machine is what I find most objectionable.
If ever society goes in a direction you disagree with, you may be forced to acquiesce simply because of a financial inability to disconnect.
It is a moral responsibility to not end up in this situation&mdash;to be able to refuse eating the bugs.</p>
<p>One cannot help but liken the situation to wealthy, fat mosquitoes sucking all the blood out of poor, emaciated sheep.
It should come as no surprise that I resist this in all its form, and I encourage you to do the same.
Purchase&mdash;and take care of&mdash;your things.
Go ahead and cancel those subscription services.
Don&rsquo;t rent&mdash;buy.
It&rsquo;s a good step in reducing your reliance on the machine, it builds up your finances over time, and leads to a much more fulfilling life.</p>
