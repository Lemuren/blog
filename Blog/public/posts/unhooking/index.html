    <p>A few years ago I got in the habit of writing custom stylesheets for websites I use often.
I still think this is a good idea, but the better idea is simply to use the internet less.
Eventually, I stopped doing this.
Then, about a week ago, I remembered the existence of these types of custom CSS extensions, and decided to use one to tackle a problem I&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>I find myself sometimes falling into the fabled &ldquo;YouTube rabbit-hole&rdquo;.
What starts out as me earnestly wanting to watch either a guide or a single new video from a channel I follow, very often led to me watching some of the &ldquo;recommended videos&rdquo; that are displayed next to the one I was watching.
This turned what should&rsquo;ve been a quick 15&ndash;20 minutes of content consumption into sometimes hours of wasted time.</p>
<p>I decided to install an RSS reader, which is a significant step toward unhooking yourself from the algorithm.
This, however, still had the issue that whenever I chose to visit the website of a post (rather than simply reading it in my RSS reader, which is preferred) the site&rsquo;s algorithm immediately began its work of sinking its claws into me.
Thus, I installed <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a> which is a custom stylesheet extension for Firefox.</p>
<p>I used it to hide all &ldquo;recommended videos&rdquo; nonsense on YouTube.
Now when I watch a video, that&rsquo;s all there is.
There is no &ldquo;Up next&rdquo;, no &ldquo;Related videos&rdquo;, and no &ldquo;You might like&hellip;&rdquo;.
The obvious benefit is two-fold:
First, I no longer need to use my willpower.
Instead, the stylesheet prevents me from even seeing temptation.
Second, I waste much less time on YouTube.</p>
<p>From all this it might sound like I&rsquo;m some hopeless YouTube addict.
I don&rsquo;t think I am, at least not any more than most people are addicted to some form of &ldquo;content&rdquo;.
In truth, I think we&rsquo;re all a little bit too addicted to consuming content these days.
Your poison might be Twitter, or Instagram or, heaven forbid, TikTok.
Unfortunately, these are all smartphone apps (at least, that&rsquo;s the primary way they&rsquo;re used).
Here my recommendation is simply to get rid of your smartphone, and, if that&rsquo;s not possible, to cut your smartphone usage to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p>For those of you whose content addiction is still accessed through a desktop browser, however, I think this remedy might be of use.
I know it has been helpful for me.</p>
<p>Minimizing content consumption can also be done by, as mentioned above, subscribing to RSS feeds.
There&rsquo;s probably upwards of hundreds of RSS readers, but I recommend using one that is terminal-based.
The benefits of using an RSS reader include: not being steered by an algorithm designed to keep you maximally engaged and waste as much time as possible; no censoring or filtering of content; and the ability to gather disparate sources of (often, much higher quality) content into one place.</p>
<p>Setting up an RSS reader is dead-simple.
Pick your favorite one (I recommend <a href="https://newsboat.org/index.html">Newsboat</a>) and start adding feeds to it.
Soon, <em>you</em> will be the one who decides what content you consume, and when, not the algorithm.</p>
