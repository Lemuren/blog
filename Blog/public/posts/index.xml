      <description>One pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed in software is that beautiful code often has fewer bugs than ugly code. Why should this be? Indeed, one can write code that is beautiful and code that is ugly that both compile down to the same instructions. We&amp;rsquo;re often also told that code aesthetics don&amp;rsquo;t matter, or at the very least, that people put too much emphasis on it. I think beautiful code matters for more reasons than the purely measurable, practical ones, but also I believe code aesthetics has an impact on the practical.</description>

      <description>To keep your filesystem from becoming a mess, I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to decide on a naming scheme to use for your files. This is very similar to using a style guide for formatting source code when programming. You decide on a set of rules, and stick to them. These rules can be as simple or complicated as you wish.
There&amp;rsquo;s essentially only two considerations:
 How Linux interacts with names; for instance on the command line and when writing scripts.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ll own nothing and you&amp;rsquo;ll be happy. It seems everything is turning into a subscription service these days. Not only do we subscribe to more services than ever before, but more and more things that used to be one-time purchases are turning to subscription models. You can no longer buy licenses to use a piece of software; instead, you subscribe to a service which lets you use that piece of software.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I got in the habit of writing custom stylesheets for websites I use often. I still think this is a good idea, but the better idea is simply to use the internet less. Eventually, I stopped doing this. Then, about a week ago, I remembered the existence of these types of custom CSS extensions, and decided to use one to tackle a problem I&amp;rsquo;ve had.
I find myself sometimes falling into the fabled &amp;ldquo;YouTube rabbit-hole&amp;rdquo;.</description>
